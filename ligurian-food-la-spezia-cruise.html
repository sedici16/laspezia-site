  <article class="content-container">

    <p>Liguria has one of the most distinctive regional cuisines in Italy, and it's one of the least understood internationally. Pesto is Ligurian â€” but the version you've eaten in restaurants around the world is a pale approximation of what you'll eat here, made with the tiny-leafed basil that grows in the microclimate of the Genoese hills, cold-pressed local olive oil, and pine nuts or walnuts from the surrounding forests. Everything else follows the same principle: ingredients of extraordinary quality, prepared simply, in a tradition that has barely changed in centuries.</p>

    <p>A port day at La Spezia is an excellent opportunity to eat very well if you know what to look for. This guide covers the essential Ligurian dishes, where to find them, and what separates the authentic version from the tourist approximation.</p>

    <h2>Focaccia: The Essential Introduction</h2>

    <p>Every part of Liguria has its own focaccia tradition, and La Spezia's is distinct from what you'll find in Genoa, Recco, or Camogli. La Spezia focaccia is thin â€” almost cracker-thin at its best â€” heavily oiled, baked in large rectangular trays, and eaten warm within an hour of coming out of the oven. It's made in specialist bakeries (forno or panificio) that open early in the morning and sell out through the course of the day.</p>

    <p>The best focaccia in La Spezia comes from the area around the Mercato Centrale. Buy a slice at the bakery counter, eat it standing on the street or sitting on a bollard by the port, and understand immediately why Ligurians treat this as a breakfast food rather than a bread accompaniment. There is a version with olives (con olive) and a version with onions (alla cipolla) â€” both are good, but the plain version, perfectly executed, is the one to start with.</p>

    <h2>Farinata: Chickpea Flatbread</h2>

    <p>Farinata is among the most ancient street foods in Liguria â€” a flatbread made from chickpea flour, water, olive oil, and salt, poured thin into a large copper or steel pan and baked in a wood-burning oven at high heat. The result is something between a pancake, a tart, and a flatbread: crispy at the edges, tender and slightly custardy at the center, with a smoky, earthy flavor from the chickpea flour and the wood smoke.</p>

    <p>Farinata is sold at forno shops and at specialist restaurants called farinotterie. It's eaten at any time of day but is particularly good in the morning. Order it with a twist of black pepper â€” the Ligurian habit is to eat it plain, with only pepper added. The La Spezia area calls it fainÃ  in dialect. A portion costs almost nothing and is one of the most satisfying things you can eat in this part of Italy.</p>

    <h2>Trofie al Pesto: The Benchmark Dish</h2>

    <p>Trofie are a short, twisted pasta shape native to eastern Liguria â€” specifically to Recco, near Genoa, but now made throughout the region. They're dressed with pesto prepared in the Ligurian tradition: basil, pine nuts (or walnuts), garlic, Parmigiano Reggiano, Pecorino, and olive oil, ground together in a mortar. The pasta is often served with green beans and small potatoes boiled together â€” a combination that sounds unorthodox but works beautifully with the pesto dressing.</p>

    <p>The test of a good pesto in Liguria is the olive oil and the basil. The oil should be the local product â€” lighter and less peppery than Tuscan oil, with a more delicate flavor profile. The basil should be the small-leafed variety grown in PrÃ , near Genoa, which has a sweetness and lack of the anise notes found in basil grown elsewhere. A restaurant serving genuine trofie al pesto in La Spezia will use these ingredients; one serving a version made with imported olive oil and industrial pesto sauce is not worth your time.</p>

    <h2>Local Anchovies: Acciughe di Monterosso</h2>

    <p>The anchovies caught and processed in the Cinque Terre area â€” particularly at Monterosso al Mare â€” have Protected Geographical Indication status and are among the finest preserved anchovies in Italy. They're larger than the typical preserved anchovy, with a more complex flavor that comes from the specific feeding grounds and the traditional salt-curing process that can last up to a year.</p>

    <p>In restaurants around La Spezia and Cinque Terre, local anchovies are served in multiple forms: marinated in lemon juice with fresh herbs (alici marinate), lightly battered and fried (fritte), or stuffed with ricotta or herb breadcrumbs and baked. A plate of mixed anchovy preparations with a glass of Vermentino is one of the great simple pleasures of eating in this part of Italy. In the Mercato Centrale, you can buy jars of salted anchovies to take home.</p>

    <h2>Muscoli: Gulf of La Spezia Mussels</h2>

    <p>The mussels grown in the sheltered waters of the Gulf of La Spezia are a local specialty with their own geographical designation. They're farmed on ropes suspended from floating platforms in the gulf and harvested throughout the year, with the best quality in autumn and winter. They're larger and more flavorful than typical farmed mussels, and you'll find them on menus across the region.</p>

    <p>In La Spezia and Porto Venere, the classic preparation is muscoli ripieni â€” stuffed mussels. The mussel is opened, a mixture of breadcrumbs, parsley, garlic, egg, and Parmigiano is spooned in, and the shell is closed and baked or simmered in tomato sauce. It's labor-intensive and entirely worth it. Steamed muscoli in white wine with crusty bread for the broth is the simpler preparation and equally good.</p>

    <h2>Ligurian Truffles: The Region's Hidden Food Treasure</h2>

    <p>Most visitors to Liguria associate truffles with Piedmont or Umbria. This is geographically understandable â€” Alba and Norcia are the famous truffle centers of Italy. But the Ligurian Apennines, the hills rising directly behind La Spezia, produce excellent truffles, and the truffle-hunting tradition in this part of Liguria is centuries old.</p>

    <p>Black truffles grow in the oak and hazel forests above the gulf from autumn through the winter months. White truffles appear more rarely but in certain years in significant quantities. Local hunters work these forests with trained dogs, and the truffles they find appear on restaurant menus in La Spezia and the surrounding towns as shaved additions to pasta, risotto, eggs, and bruschetta.</p>

    <p>For cruise passengers who want to experience truffle culture beyond a restaurant plate, the <a href="la-spezia-food-experiences-comparison.html">La Spezia food experiences comparison</a> covers every available option â€” and the <a href="truffle-hunt-la-spezia-cruise-port.html">truffle hunt shore excursion from La Spezia</a> takes you into the forest itself, participating in the hunt and then eating what you've found in a genuine Ligurian setting. It's the most immersive food experience available from the port.</p>

    <h2>SciacchetrÃ : The Cinque Terre Dessert Wine</h2>

    <p>The steep terraced vineyards of Cinque Terre produce a range of white wines, but the most distinctive is SciacchetrÃ  â€” a passito wine made from partially dried Bosco, Albarola, and Vermentino grapes. It's sweet but not cloying, with a complexity that comes from the oxidative aging process. Production quantities are tiny and prices are high, but a small glass at the end of a Cinque Terre lunch is a proper regional experience.</p>

    <p>For dry wines, the Vermentino DOC wines from the Colli di Luni area â€” the hills directly north of La Spezia â€” are excellent with seafood and available throughout the region. They're lighter and more mineral than Vermentino from Sardinia, reflecting the cooler climate and different soils of Liguria.</p>
