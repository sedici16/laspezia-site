    <h1>Best Beaches Near La Spezia Cruise Port: Where to Swim and Relax</h1>
  </div>

  <article class="content-container">

    <p>La Spezia sits at the heart of one of the most beautiful stretches of Italian coastline, and within easy reach of the cruise port lie several beaches that rival anything else in the Mediterranean. The Gulf of La Spezia is sheltered and calm, with warm water from June through September. Whether you want a classic sandy beach, a secluded rocky cove, or a dramatic sea-cliff setting, the options within an hour of the port are genuinely outstanding.</p>

    <h2>Monterosso al Mare â€” Best Sandy Beach</h2>

    <p>Monterosso al Mare, the northernmost of the Cinque Terre villages, has the only proper sandy beach in the entire Cinque Terre area. It's a legitimate beach destination â€” a long crescent of sand with beach clubs, sun loungers, and parasols for hire, plus a free section at the southern end where you can spread a towel without paying.</p>

    <p>The water at Monterosso is clear, calm, and warm by mid-June. The beach is backed by the old town on one side and the new town on the other. You can spend the morning swimming, eat an outstanding lunch of local anchovies at one of the waterfront restaurants, and still be back on the train to La Spezia with plenty of time before your ship departs.</p>

    <p>Getting there: take the train from La Spezia Centrale â€” approximately 25 minutes. In peak season, the beach fills up significantly by mid-morning. Aim for an early start.</p>

    <h2>Lerici â€” Best Accessible Beach Near the Port</h2>

    <p>Lerici is the easiest beach destination to reach from La Spezia cruise port â€” about 10 minutes by taxi or 30 minutes by local bus along the eastern shore of the gulf. The town beach at Lerici is a mix of sand and fine gravel, calm and clear, with the medieval castle rising above on the headland and the pastel-colored town providing the backdrop.</p>

    <p>Lerici has a genuinely local atmosphere. It's popular with Italian families in the summer but rarely overwhelmed in the way that Cinque Terre becomes on busy cruise days. The beach is divided between free sections and private beach clubs (stabilimenti), where you can rent a sun lounger and parasol for the day.</p>

    <p>Beyond Lerici's main beach, the nearby hamlet of San Terenzo has a smaller, less busy beach that tends to be quieter even on crowded days. For more details on what else to do while in Lerici, see our complete <a href="lerici-from-la-spezia-cruise.html">Lerici day trip guide</a>.</p>

    <h2>Fiascherino â€” Best Cove Beach</h2>

    <p>About 15 minutes by taxi south of Lerici lies Fiascherino, a small, protected bay with crystal-clear turquoise water and a pebble beach backed by pine trees and olive groves. This is one of the most beautiful small beaches in Liguria and sees relatively few visitors outside the Italian holiday weeks of August. DH Lawrence spent time here â€” he wrote parts of "The Lost Girl" in a house overlooking this bay.</p>

    <p>Fiascherino has a small bar and restaurant at the beach, a beach club with sun loungers, and a handful of local boats moored in the bay. The water is exceptionally clear and the cove provides natural shelter from swell.</p>

    <h2>Maralunga â€” The Hidden Alternative</h2>

    <p>Near Fiascherino, the tiny inlet of Maralunga is even smaller and quieter. There's no beach establishment â€” just rocks, turquoise water, and the sound of cicadas. Getting there requires a short walk through olive trees from the road. It's the kind of place that locals know and visitors rarely find, and it offers a genuinely private swimming experience even in the height of summer. Bring your own water and snacks.</p>

    <h2>Porto Venere and Palmaria Island</h2>

    <p>Porto Venere itself doesn't have a conventional beach, but a three-minute boat crossing from Porto Venere reaches Palmaria Island, where the Spiaggia della Batteria is a shingle beach in a dramatic setting between cliff faces, accessible only by boat. The water here is extraordinarily clear.</p>

    <p>Visiting Palmaria's beach works well if you're already planning to go to Porto Venere. Our guide to <a href="porto-venere-from-la-spezia-cruise.html">Porto Venere from La Spezia</a> covers the full day trip logistics.</p>

    <h2>Which Beach Is Right for Your Day in Port?</h2>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <p><strong>Sandy beach with facilities:</strong> Monterosso al Mare (25 min by train)<br>
      <strong>Closest to port with a town to explore:</strong> Lerici (10 min by taxi)<br>
      <strong>Seclusion and natural beauty:</strong> Fiascherino or Maralunga (30â€“40 min from port)</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Practical Notes for Beach Days</h2>

    <p>Beach clubs (stabilimenti) rent sun loungers and parasols by the day, typically for 15 to 30 euros for a double lounger and parasol. The price includes use of changing rooms and showers. Free beaches (spiagge libere) exist alongside beach clubs â€” the water is identical, just bring your own towel.</p>

    <p>Water shoes are worth bringing to pebble and rocky beaches like Lerici and Fiascherino. Sun protection is essential â€” the reflective water intensifies UV exposure even on overcast days.</p>

    <h2>Combining a Beach Day with Other Activities</h2>

    <p>A beach morning pairs well with a half-day excursion in the afternoon, or vice versa. Lerici in the morning and a truffle hunt in the Ligurian hills in the afternoon is an unconventional but excellent day â€” seafront relaxation followed by forest exploration and a tasting lunch. See our <a href="half-day-excursions-la-spezia-cruise.html">guide to half-day excursions from La Spezia</a> for the best options to combine with a beach visit.</p>
